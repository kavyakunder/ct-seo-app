## AWS Amplify Deployment 

### Step 1. Prepare your react application for production build : 

 - Make sure your React app is ready for production

         npm run build 

 - This will create a build (or dist or public) directory with your production-ready files.

### Step 2. Create an AWS Amplify App

- Log in to the [AWS Amplify Console.](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
- Search for AWS Amplify in search bar and click on "create new app".

### Step 3. Connect Your Repository

- **Choose a repository provider**: Select your Git provider(e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, AWS CodeCommit) and authorize AWS Amplify to access your repository.

### Step 5. Deploy the App
- **Deploy**: Click Save and deploy. AWS Amplify will build your app and deploy it to a globally available CDN (via Amazon CloudFront).
